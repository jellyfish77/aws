# Simulate Random Moisture Levels

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-samples/latest/catalog/python-iot-plantwateringsample-simulate-random-moisture-levels.py.html

simulate-random-moisture-levels.py demonstrates how to simulate soil moisture readings by generating random data. You push that data into the related shadow in AWS IoT.

## Execute

	python simulate-random-moisture-levels.py

Another possibility is to add the following line to the top of the script:

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	
This will instruct your shell to execute the script via python instead of trying to interpret it on its own.

	./python simulate-random-moisture-levels.py
