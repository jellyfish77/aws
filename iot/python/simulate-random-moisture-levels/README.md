## Execute

    python simulate-random-moisture-levels.py

Alternatively, add the following line to the top of the script:

    #!/usr/bin/env python

This will instruct your shell to execute the script via python instead of trying to interpret it on its own.

    ./python simulate-random-moisture-levels.py
